# Folder for the exam and midterms

Before the exam:
 - Ensure that the `irlc`-code generally works (you can run exercises, the packages we use such as `gymnasium` or `numpy` are installed, etc.)
 - You have no problem running the various `unitgrade`-test scripts and generating `.token`-files

During the exam:
 - Download a `.zip` file with the code from the digital exam
   - For the midterm, you can find the file on DTU Learn
 - The `zip` file will contain the toolbox code including solutions. It will also contain a directory:
    ```bash
    irlc/exam/exam2024spring
    ```
 - This directory contains the code you need to work on for the exam. Replace the directory on your local computer with this directory and you should be all set up
 - The `.zip` file will also contain solutions to nearly all exercises. Use these if benefits you.
